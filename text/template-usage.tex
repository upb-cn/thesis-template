Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

The above shows a normal paragraph for this document. By default, the paragraph is not indented. If you want to cite a reference, you can use the \mintinline{latex}{\cite} command. Here is an example: HIRE is a novel resource scheduler for in-network computing~\cite{2021:asplos:hire}. The list of references is shown at the end of the document in the ``References'' section. We use \mintinline{latex}{biblatex} to manage references and the source of bib items is specified at the beginning with the command \mintinline{latex}{\addbibresource{...}}. It is recommended that you collect the bib entries of papers from \href{https://dblp.org}{DBLP}.

You can also create unnumbered and numbered lists as in the following examples. Note that the list should not go deeper than two levels; otherwise, it becomes ugly. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
    \item Last item 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item First subitem
            \item Second subitem
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First entry
    \item Second entry
    \item Third entry
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item First subentry
            \item Second subentry
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

If you have some text you want to put in monospace (e.g., cite something in verbatim), you can use the \verb+\verb+ command to do that. Alternatively, you can use \mintinline{latex}{\mintinline{...}{...}}. The difference is that the latter is highlighted with a light gray background and we can also turn on syntax highlighting for many programming or scripting languages. Here is an example to compare these two: \verb+exit 0+ and \mintinline{bash}{exit 0}. For this reason, the latter is always preferred when it comes to code. 

If you want to write a code block, you can use the \mintinline{latex}{minted} environment, where you can turn on the syntax highlighting if you want. Here is an example for a shell script.

\begin{minted}{bash}
echo "Hello world!"
\end{minted}

The following is an example for a C code snippet.

\begin{minted}{c}
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}

Figure~\ref{fig:upb-logo} depicts the logo of UPB. By default, figures should always be put at the top of the page. The same applies to tables. Table~\ref{tab:info} shows the group member information. Avoid using vertical bars in a table unless it is really necessary. All cells should be left-aligned except cells with numbers which should be right-aligned or dot-aligned. The caption for the table should sit at the top of the table, while it is at the bottom for figures.
