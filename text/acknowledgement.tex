\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

% Please replace the following text with your own

Here you can express your appreciation to anyone who has helped you during your thesis work, probably starting from your reviewers and supervisors. You can also write about special moments that are worth mentioning in your journey.

You are also free to skip this part if there is nothing worthwhile to mention (which I hope is unlikely). Negative comments are also possible, although not encouraged since you will probably regret it later. Who knows what will happen in the future?
